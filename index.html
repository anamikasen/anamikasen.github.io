								Hey there, I am Anamika and I have been working as a Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.microstrategy.com/en">Microstrategy Inc.</a> since Aug 2019. 
								<br>
								<br>
								 During my tenure here, I have worked on some very interesting projects ranging from application development of an internal load testing tool which was presented in <a href="https://www.microstrategy.com/en/resources/webinar/the-best-of-world-2021">MicroStrategy World 2020</a> to working on cloud orchestration where we deploy the software on Microsoft Azure. 
								<br>
								<br>
								My tech stack currently involves a lot of Java, Python, Bash and Powershell, Azure and AWS. I have also worked on development of RESTful APIs. I have delivered independent features as well as worked on resolving high priority production issues. 
								<br>
								<br>
								I enjoy challenges and love working in a collaborative environment. Always eager to learn and grow more!
